### Display in Sales Order Grid
If you want to display UTM_Source in your Sales order Grid, you can install [Grid Control](https://github.com/magento-hackathon/GridControl) module. This module makes use of Grid Control to add new column there if you want to.

## Usage

* User hits you site with tracking parameters: www.yoursite.com?utm_source=abc&utm_medium=def&utm_content=ghi&utm_campaign=jkl&utm_term=mno
* The parameters are saved to session and cookie
* When the customer signes up, the tracking string is saved in `customer_entity_varchar` table as attribute `customer_campaign_params`. When the customer places an order, the tracking string is saved in the `sales_flat_order` table in the `order_campaign_params` column.
  * `utm_source=abc|utm_medium=def|utm_content=ghi|utm_campaign=jkl|utm_term=mno`
  * Only the paramter utm_source is mandatory, the other paramters can be empty
  * The tracking string then looks like that: `utm_source=abc|utm_medium=|utm_content=|utm_campaign=|utm_term=`
